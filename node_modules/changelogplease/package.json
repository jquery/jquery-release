The generated changelogs are written in markdown.\n\nSupport this project by [donating on Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/scottgonzalez/).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install changelogplease\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar changelog = require( \"changelogplease\" );\nvar parsed = changelog({\n\tticketUrl: \"https://github.com/scottgonzalez/changelogplease/issues/{id}\",\n\tcommitUrl: \"https://github.com/scottgonzalez/changelogplease/commit/{id}\",\n\trepo: \"/path/to/repo\",\n\tcommittish: \"1.2.3..1.2.4\"\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n### changelog( options, callback )\n\n* `options` (Object): Options for creating the changelog.\n  * `ticketUrl` (String): Template for ticket/issue URLs; `{id}` will be replaced with the ticket id.\n  * `commitUrl (String)`: Template for commit URLs; `{id}` will be replaced with the commit hash.\n  * `repo` (String): Path to the repository.\n  * `committish` (String): The range of commits for the changelog.\n* `callback` (Function; `function( error, log )`): Function to invoke after generating the changelog.\n  * `log` (String): Generated changelog, written in markdown.\n\n### Changelog\n\n`changelog( options, callback )` is a shorthand for the following:\n\n```js\nvar Changelog = require( \"changelogplease\" ).Changelog;\nvar instance = new Changelog( options );\ninstance.parse( callback );\n```\n\nChangelog generation is tailored to a specific format based on the needs of the various jQuery\nprojects. However, the `Changelog` constructor and prototype are exposed to allow flexibility.\nBe aware that these methods are not currently documented because they may change. Feel free to\nsubmit [feature requests](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/changelogplease/issues/new) if you don't\nfeel comfortable hacking in your own changes (or even if you do).\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2014 Scott González.
