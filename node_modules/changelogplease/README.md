## API

### changelog( options, callback )

* `options` (Object): Options for creating the changelog.
  * `ticketUrl` (String): Template for ticket/issue URLs; `{id}` will be replaced with the ticket id.
  * `commitUrl (String)`: Template for commit URLs; `{id}` will be replaced with the commit hash.
  * `repo` (String): Path to the repository.

### Changelog

`changelog( options, callback )` is a shorthand for the following:

```js
var Changelog = require( "changelogplease" ).Changelog;
var instance = new Changelog( options );
instance.parse( callback );
```

Changelog generation is tailored to a specific format based on the needs of the various jQuery
projects. However, the `Changelog` constructor and prototype are exposed to allow flexibility.
Be aware that these methods are not currently documented because they may change. Feel free to
submit [feature requests](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/changelogplease/issues/new) if you don't
feel comfortable hacking in your own changes (or even if you do).
